The Splash Page
###############
As you will see mentioned in the "How Nodogsplash (NDS) Works" section, an initial port 80 request is generated on a client device, either by the user manually browsing to an http web page, or, more usually, automatically by the client device's built in Captive Portal Detection (CPD).

This request is intercepted by NDS and an html Splash Page is served to the user of the client device to enable them to authenticate and obtain Internet access.

The NoDogSplash Templated Splash Page
*************************************
 The splash page generated from the basic splash.html file installed with NDS includes Template Variables (as listed in the splash.html file).
